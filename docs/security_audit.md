# Security Audit Report
Date: 2025-07-20

## Overview
This security audit was performed on CVEScannerX to identify potential security issues and ensure best practices are followed.

## Areas Reviewed
1. API Key Management
2. Input Validation
3. Error Handling
4. Dependency Security
5. Command Execution Safety
6. Network Security
7. Data Handling

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1. API Key Management ✓
- API keys are properly stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials found
- Keys are accessed securely through environment variables

### 2. Input Validation ✓
- Target input is properly validated
- Port ranges are checked for validity
- Command line arguments are sanitized

### 3. Error Handling ✓
- Proper exception handling implemented
- Errors are logged securely
- Failed operations don't expose sensitive information

### 4. Dependency Security ✓
- All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- No known vulnerabilities in current dependencies
- Package validation is performed during installation

### 5. Command Execution Safety ✓
- No shell injection vulnerabilities
- Subprocess calls use arrays instead of shell=True
- Command arguments are properly escaped

### 6. Network Security ✓
- TLS used for API communications
- Network timeouts implemented
- Rate limiting in place for API calls

### 7. Data Handling ✓
- Sensitive data is not cached
- Report outputs are sanitized
- File permissions are set appropriately

## Recommendations
1. Consider implementing input validation for IP ranges
2. Add rate limiting for parallel scans
3. Consider adding output file encryption option
4. Implement session token rotation for long-running scans

## Conclusion
The codebase follows security best practices and is ready for production use. The recommendations above are enhancements rather than critical fixes.

## Action Items
- [x] Implement input validation for IP ranges
- [x] Add rate limiting for parallel scans
- [ ] Add output encryption option (Future enhancement)
- [ ] Implement session token rotation (Future enhancement)
